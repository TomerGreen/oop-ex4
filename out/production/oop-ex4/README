=============================

*  We chose to implement iterator() by first creating a linkedList which contains the values in the tree in ascending
order. The AvlTree iterator is than the iterator of this linkedList. This utilizes the iterator implementation of
a linked list without having to implement iterator methods ourselves. It also enables us to iterate over the tree as
it was when the iterator was created, instead of its current state, as required according to answers in the forum.

*  In order to refrain from having to probe the tree twice in every add operation, we wrote a helper function that,
when given a value, returns either a node with that value, or the parent node of that value were it added to the tree.
We can then check if the value exists and get the node we should attach it to in one probing.
